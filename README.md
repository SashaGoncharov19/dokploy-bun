# Dokploy Bun

Self-hosted PaaS — deploy applications, databases and Docker Compose stacks on your own
servers, with Traefik routing, backups, monitoring and multi-server support.

This is [Dokploy](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy) running on [Bun](https://bun.sh)
instead of Node.js. Same product, same features, different runtime.

**[sashagoncharov19.github.io/dokploy-bun](https://sashagoncharov19.github.io/dokploy-bun/)** — what it is, the numbers, and how to install it.

**Images:** `ghcr.io/sashagoncharov19/dokploy-bun` · `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`

---

## Install

On a server you intend to dedicate to it, as root:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SashaGoncharov19/dokploy-bun/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then open `http://<your-server-ip>:3000`.

The installer sets up Docker, initialises Swarm, generates credentials into Docker
Secrets and starts Postgres, Traefik and the app. It detects Proxmox LXC and adjusts
service discovery accordingly.

**Updating**, keeping your data:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SashaGoncharov19/dokploy-bun/main/install.sh | sh -s update
```

Re-running the *full* installer over an existing database is refused with instructions,
because it would regenerate credentials the database will not accept. To wipe and start
clean — **this destroys all data** — `export DOKPLOY_RESET_DB=true` first.

### Requirements

Any x86-64 or arm64 host with Docker. A Raspberry Pi 5 works; use an SSD rather than an
SD card, since deployments do a lot of disk I/O, and expect to want 8GB of RAM once
Postgres, Traefik and your own containers are running.

## Features

Everything upstream Dokploy does, and all of it available. There is no licence gating in
this build — white-labelling, SSO, SCIM, custom roles, audit logs and forward-auth work
out of the box, and nothing contacts a licence server.

- **Applications** in any language — Node, PHP, Python, Go, Ruby, Rust
- **Databases** — PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, libsql, with scheduled backups
- **Docker Compose** stacks, deployed and managed natively
- **Multi-server** — deploy to remote hosts over SSH; **multi-node** via Docker Swarm
- **Templates** — one-click open-source apps (Plausible, Pocketbase, Cal.com, …)
- **Traefik** routing and TLS, configured for you
- **Monitoring** — live CPU, memory, storage and network per resource
- **Terminals and logs** in the browser, per container and per server
- **Notifications** — Slack, Discord, Telegram, email
- **CLI and API**, with a generated OpenAPI spec

## What running on Bun changes

Nothing about how you use it. The differences are in the build and in the running server.

**Build and packaging:**

| | Node + pnpm | Bun |
|---|---|---|
| Install (warm cache) | 21.9s | **5.5s** |
| CI build job | 3m51s | **2m39s** |
| api service image | 1.25GB | **234MB** |
| web image | 3.25GB | 3.22GB |

**The running server**, measured head-to-head against a build of the pre-migration
commit — same host, same PostgreSQL, byte-identical SSR output — with medians over
repeated runs:

| | Node | Bun |
|---|---|---|
| Shutdown (`docker stop` to exited) | 3019ms | **318ms** |
| Cold boot, incl. 186 migrations | 4720ms | **3411ms** |
| Warm start | 4244ms | **3345ms** |
| Memory, idle | 753 MiB | **626 MiB** |
| Memory, after load | 1315 MiB | **760 MiB** |
| `/register` SSR throughput | 780 rps | 745 rps |
| `/api/health` throughput | 8855 rps | 8681 rps |

**Throughput did not improve.** Both endpoints are inside noise, and the baseline is
nominally ahead on each. The request path is bounded by Next.js and React rendering,
not by the JavaScript engine, so changing the engine does not move it — and this README
is not going to pretend otherwise.

What did move is startup, shutdown and memory. Shutdown by 9.5×, which is the one that
shows up in practice: the service runs with `--update-order stop-first`, so every
update waits for it.

The service images collapse because `bun build` produces a self-contained bundle — they
ship no `node_modules` at all. The web image does not shrink, and that is worth saying
plainly: its bulk is the Docker CLI, nixpacks, railpack and buildpacks, which a runtime
swap cannot touch.

Removed along the way: `tsx`, `esbuild`, `rimraf`, `tsc-alias`, `node-pty`, `bcrypt`,
`postgres.js`, `@hono/node-server`, `redis`, `ioredis`. Two native modules became
built-in APIs — `node-pty` → `Bun.Terminal`, `bcrypt` → `Bun.password` — and existing
password hashes keep working in both directions, so upgrading and rolling back are both
safe.

These are single-host benchmarks of a freshly started server, not observations of a
production deployment under sustained real traffic. The harness is committed as
[`scripts/runtime-benchmark.ts`](scripts/runtime-benchmark.ts) so the numbers can be
re-run rather than believed.

**The migration is documented in full**, including what broke and how:
[docs/bun-migration/](docs/bun-migration/PLAN.md).

## Status

Running and verified on arm64 hardware: all six WebSocket features (container terminal
and logs, server terminal, deployment console, monitoring, drawer logs), registration,
the migration chain, and real workloads — a multi-service Compose stack and a Gitea
instance, both deployed and serving.

The test suite — 1,035 tests, 877 of them on `bun test` and 158 still on vitest — passes
in CI on both runners.

Known gaps are listed honestly in
[SPIKE-RESULTS.md](docs/bun-migration/SPIKE-RESULTS.md); the notable one is that no
instance has yet run under sustained production load.

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SashaGoncharov19/dokploy-bun.git
cd dokploy-bun
bun install
bun run --filter '*' typecheck
bun run test
```

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.14+. Node.js and pnpm are not needed.

Conventions live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), branch naming in
[docs/BRANCHING.md](docs/BRANCHING.md), and the rules for staying mergeable with upstream
in [docs/FORK-STRATEGY.md](docs/FORK-STRATEGY.md).

### Releases

`v0.30.2-bun.1` means upstream's v0.30.2 running on Bun. The suffix appears in the UI,
the startup log and the image tags.

Two channels, one branch each:

| Channel | Branch | Tag | Image |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stable | `main` | `v0.30.2-bun.1` | `:latest`, `:v0.30.2-bun.1` |
| Pre-release | `canary` | `v0.30.2-bun.1-canary.1` | `:canary` |

`install.sh` resolves the latest **stable** release, so a pre-release never reaches a
machine that did not ask for it. To follow canary deliberately, set
`DOKPLOY_VERSION=canary` before running the installer.

Upgrading in place is a service update against the tag you want:

```bash
docker service update --image ghcr.io/sashagoncharov19/dokploy-bun:latest --force dokploy
```

Migrations run on boot and are forward-only, so **rolling back to an older image after
an upgrade that migrated the schema is not supported.** Snapshot the database first if
you need a way back.

## Credits

Dokploy is built by [Mauricio Siu](https://github.com/Siumauricio) and
[its contributors](https://github.com/dokploy/dokploy/graphs/contributors). This fork
changes the runtime; the software is theirs.

It tracks upstream and merges their releases — see
[FORK-STRATEGY.md](docs/FORK-STRATEGY.md) — and deliberately stays structurally identical
to it, so improvements can flow in both directions.

## License

Follows upstream: [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.MD), except `/proprietary` directories, which are
under the [DSAL](LICENSE_PROPRIETARY.md).
